        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "   -Functions can be called only by its name, as it is defined independently. But methods can't be called by its name only, we need to invoke the class by a reference of that class in which it is defined, i.e. method is defined within a class and hence they are dependent on that class.\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "   - In Python, the terms \"arguments\" and \"parameters\" are distinct concepts related to functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "   Parameters: These are the variables listed inside the parentheses in a function's def statement (its definition).Parameters act as placeholders for the values that the function expects to receive when it is called. They define the inputs the function can accept and are part of the function's signature.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Arguments: These are the actual values or expressions passed to a function when it is called. When a function is invoked, the arguments provided are assigned to the corresponding parameters in the function's definition.\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "   - You can define a Python function with the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses with optional parameters, a colon, and then an indented code block. You call a Python function by writing its name followed by parentheses, enclosing any necessary arguments, to execute its code block.\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "   - The purpose of the return statement in a Python function is to send a value or set of values back to the caller of the function. When a return statement is encountered during function execution, the function immediately stops and the specified value(s) are passed back to the point in the code where the function was called.\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "   - In Python, iterators are objects that represent a stream of data and implement the iterator protocol, which consists of the __iter__() and __next__() methods. The __next__() method is used to retrieve the next item from the sequence, and it raises a StopIteration exception when there are no more items. Iterators maintain an internal state, allowing them to keep track of their position during iteration.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "   - Generators in Python are a special type of iterable that allow for memory-efficient and lazy evaluation of sequences. Unlike regular functions that compute and return all values at once, generators yield values one at a time as they are requested, pausing their execution state between yields. This makes them ideal for working with large datasets or infinite sequences where storing all values in memory simultaneously would be impractical or impossible.\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "   - There are many advantages to using generators in Python, such as improved memory management, time savings, and flexibility. Generators can also produce infinite sequences and are more readable than traditional loops.       \n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "   - A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Unlike a regular function defined with def, a lambda function does not have a name and is restricted to a single expression, which is implicitly returned.\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "   - The map() function in Python is a built-in higher-order function used to apply a specified function to each item in an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or set), returning an iterator that yields the results.\n",
        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "  -  The map(), filter(), and reduce() functions in Python are powerful tools for functional programming, each serving a distinct purpose in transforming and processing iterables.\n",
        "\n",
        "  map(): This function applies a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list or tuple) and returns a new iterable containing the results. It's used for transformation, where you want to change each element in a collection based on a specific rule.\n",
        "\n",
        "  filter(): This function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true. It's used for selection, where you want to keep only the elements that satisfy a certain condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "  reduce(): This function, found in the functools module, applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of a sequence, from left to right, so as to reduce the sequence to a single value. It's used for aggregation, where you want to combine all elements into a single result.\n",
